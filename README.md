# How Far Is Your Birthday Bot for Messenger

![](demo.gif)

Created for the AdaKerja Node.js interview. This is a Messenger bot that will:
  1. Ask the user for their name.
  2. Ask the user for their birthday.
  3. Ask if the user would like to know how many days are left before their next birthday.
  
As this is a small-scale project, all messages are saved in run-time memory. Please also provide a `.env` file if wished to test with an actual Facebook page and Messenger bot.
  
 To run the project, please run:
  1. `npm i`
  2. `npm start`
  
 Some accompanying tests can also be run by running `npm test`.
